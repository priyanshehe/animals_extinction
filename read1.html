<P>Extinction of Plants and Animals
Extinction is the death of all members of a species of plants, animals, or other organisms. One of the most dramatic examples of a modern extinction is the passenger pigeon. Until the early 1800s, billions of passenger pigeons darkened the skies of the United States in spectacular migratory flocks. Easy to trap or shoot, passenger pigeons became a popular, cheap food. Commercial hunters killed them in vast numbers, eventually decimating the population. The last passenger pigeon, named Martha, died in the Cincinnati Zoological Garden in 1914, and was donated to the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<p style="color:yellow">1690 Dodo bird  – extinct from predation by introduced pigs and cats.</p>
<p>Dodos were large birds, approximately three-feet tall, with downy grey feathers and a white plume for a tail. The Dodo had tiny wings and its sternum – an area with strong wing muscles for flying birds – was correspondingly small. The massive birds could reach a body weight of more than 20 kilograms. Dodo birds were flightless birds because they did not have any predators (animals or human) on the island of Mauritius and didn't need to fly. Therefore, they ate fruits, nuts, and seeds on the ground. Even though they couldn't fly, they could run very fast. They also went into the water and ate crabs or shellfish.</p>

<p style="color:yellow">1768 Stellar’s sea cow – extinct from hunting for fur and oil.</p>
<p>Steller's sea cow, a giant sirenian discovered in 1741 and extinct by 1768, is one of the few megafaunal mammal species to have died out during the historical period. The species is traditionally considered to have been exterminated by ‘blitzkrieg’-style direct overharvesting for food, but it has also been proposed that its extinction resulted from a sea urchin population explosion triggered by extirpation of local sea otter populations that eliminated the shallow-water kelps on which sea cows fed. Hunting records from eighteenth century Russian expeditions to the Commander Islands, in conjunction with life-history data extrapolated from dugongs, permit modelling of sea cow extinction dynamics. Sea cows were massively and wastefully overexploited, being hunted at over seven times the sustainable limit, and suggesting that the initial Bering Island sea cow population must have been higher than suggested by previous researchers to allow the species to survive even until 1768.</p>

<p>The Labrador duck (Camptorhynchus labradorius) is an extinct North American duck species. It has the distinction of being the first known endemic North American bird species to become extinct after the Columbian Exchange, with the last known sighting occurring in 1878 in Elmira, New York. The Labrador duck had an oblong head with tiny, beady eyes. The ducks body was short with short, strong feet that were placed far behind the body. The bill was almost as long as the ducks body was. The Labrador duck had small feathers with a short, rounded tail.</p>

<p>The Rocky Mountain grasshopper, or locust, was a migratory insect that in peak population years spread over the Great Plains from Canada to Texas and periodically devastated the crops of homesteaders and farmers. Locusts are highly nutritious, hence they can be excellent sources of food and feed. Locusts have been traditionally consumed in 65 countries for millennia. They are rich in industrial products like chitin, oil and bioactive proteins.</p>

<p>The thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) was a large Australian marsupial mammal that once thrived on the island of Tasmania. The thylacine was commonly referred to as the Tasmanian tiger due to its striped lower back or as the Tasmanian wolf due to its dog-like appearance. Tasmanian tigers looked a bit like striped dogs, with big jaws; yellow fur with black stripes; stumpy legs; and a long, skinny tail. The Tasmanian tiger was once the largest carnivorous marsupial on Earth.</p>

<p style="color:yellow">1952 Deepwater cisco fish - extinct from competition and predation by introduced fishes.</p>
<p>The deepwater cisco was distinguished by usually having fewer than 33 gill rakers, relatively long pectoral fins, and unpigmented jaws. It was a silvery colour with a pink or purple lustre and a green or blue back. It spawned in August and September, earlier than most other ciscoes. The Deepwater cisco was observed only in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan and while there is some discrepancy in the taxonomy between the different species, it was one of the largest ciscoes. The fish was silvery in colour with hints of pink and purple and with a green or blue back. Due to its size, it was overfished into extinction. The species was last seen in Lake Michigan in 1952.

The deepwater cisco population crashed and disappeared at the same time as many other Great Lakes fishes as they too were greatly affected by two invasive species – predation by the parasitic sea lamprey and competition from the alewife, a herring species that bypassed Niagara Falls via Welland Canal in the mid-1900s. Without any predators in the Great Lakes – Lake trout had been all but killed off by overfishing and the ever-present Sea lamprey – alewife became so abundant that they had to be controlled by the introduction of two species of Pacific salmon, coho and Chinook salmon, a case of balancing the numbers of one predatory invasive species with another.</p>

<p>Hawaii chaff flower was a species of plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It was endemic to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands of Kure, Midway, Laysan and the Pearl and Hermes Atoll. Its natural habitat was sandy shores. It became extinct due to habitat loss (residential, commercial and military installation development) and the introduction of non-native species, and was last seen in 1964. It was a perennial shrub living in dry shrublands on calcareous sand and atolls.</p>

<p>The golden toad is an extinct species of true toad that was once abundant in a small, high-altitude region of about 4 square kilometres (1.5 sq mi) in an area north of the city of Monteverde, Costa Rica. It was endemic to elfin cloud forest.Before the species went extinct, the golden toad was native to the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Costa Rica, spanning a range of approximately four square kilometres. They lived underground in burrows for the majority of the year and emerged to mate during the rainy season in spring.</p>

<p style="color:yellow">Mammoths are closely related to present-day Asian Elephants.</p>
<p>Woolly mammoth, extinct species of elephant found in fossil deposits of the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs (from about 2.6 million years ago to the present) in Europe, northern Asia, and North America. The woolly mammoth was known for its large size, fur, and imposing tusks. Thriving during the Pleistocene ice ages, woolly mammoths died out after much of their habitat was lost as Earth’s climate warmed in the aftermath of the last ice age. The species is named for the appearance of its long thick coat of fur. Woolly mammoths stood about 3 to 3.7 metres (about 10 to 12 feet) tall and weighed between 5,500 and 7,300 kg (between about 6 and 8 tons). They had a yellowish brown undercoat about 2.5 cm (about 1 inch) thick beneath a coarser outer covering of dark brown hair that grew more than 70 cm (27.5 inches) long in some individuals. Under the extremely thick skin was a layer of insulating fat at times 8 cm (3 inches) thick. Its skull was high and domelike, with large downward-directed curved tusks. The woolly mammoth’s teeth were made up of alternating plates of enamel and a denture that often became worn down by constant back-to-front chewing motions. The woolly mammoth’s ears were small, which exposed a smaller amount of surface area and was likely an adaptation to the cold climates in the Northern Hemisphere. A mound of fat, which served as an energy and water reserve, was present as a hump on the back.</p>

<p style="color:yellow">Baiji or Yangtze River Dolphin.</p>
<p>Baiji is a Chinese word meaning "a white dolphin." This species is one of the most endangered cetaceans in the world, with a population numbering in the tens or fewer.Baijis have a fusiform body with a small head, tiny eyes, prominent melon and a long, narrow beak that is slightly up-curved at the tip. The dorsal fin of the baiji is low and triangular and the flippers are broad and rounded. The dorsal portion of the body is gray with whitish streaks from the ventral area extending into the face and head region.
Female: Females are slightly larger than males. Physically Size of a Male: maximum 2.29 m (7 ft. 6 in.) where as Female: maximum 2.53 m (8 ft. 4 in.). And  Weight Male: 130 kg (290 lbs.) where as Female: 170 kg (370 lbs.) larger individuals may weigh up to 227 kg (500 lbs.). Currently only found in the Yangtze River of China. Historically, the Baiji was also found in Dongting and Poyang Lakes.The baiji has been protected by China since 1975. Chinese biologists began devising a protection strategy in 1986.By establishing reserve sites along the Yangtze River, scientists are hopeful that the species can be saved. The Baiji has been listed as Critically Endangered since 2006 and the population is still declining and may be extinct. Before 1900, there was a population around 3,000 to 5,000 individuals. Now there may be less than 10 and possibly extinct. </p>

<p style="color:yellow">Extinct Wild Ox of Europe.</p>
<p> Aurochs, (Bos primigenius), extinct wild ox of Europe, family Bovidae (order Artiodactyla), from which cattle are probably descended. The aurochs survived in central Poland until 1627. The aurochs was black, stood 1.8 metres (6 feet) high at the shoulder, and had spreading, forward-curving horns. Some German breeders claim that since 1945 they have re-created this race by crossing Spanish fighting cattle with longhorns and cattle of other breeds. Their animals, however, are smaller and, though they resemble the aurochs, probably do not have similar genetic constitutions.Aurochs are an extinct species of large wild cattle which existed across Europe, Asia and North Africa, up until the early 1600s. The auroch is not too dissimilar to cattle we are familiar with today, and in fact in 2017 scientific activity began to try and introduce a similar species of ‘wild supercow’ back into the wild. Many of our designers appeared to be familiar with the concept of the auroch, though over 25% were wildly inaccurate, producing images of dinosaurs, birds and octopus.
The auroch were one of the largest herbivores in post-glacier Europe with huge horns, reaching up to 8cm in length, a feat which none of our designers clearly depicted in their illustrations.</p>

<p style="color:yellow">Woolly Rhinoceros - Extinct Species of Rhinoceros.</p>
<p>Woolly rhinoceros, (genus Coelodonta), either of two extinct species of rhinoceros found in fossil deposits of the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs (5.3 million to 11,700 years ago) in Europe, North Africa, and Asia. It probably evolved from an earlier form, Dicerorhinus, somewhere in northeastern Asia, entered the European region, and became extinct at the end of the most recent ice age. The animal was massive, with two large horns toward the front of the skull, and was covered with a thick coat of hair. The woolly rhinoceros was also present in more temperate, nonglacial regions, where it inhabited grasslands. It was a popular subject for Stone Age painters and sculptors; their representations of the woolly rhinoceros, some of which are very accurate, are known from several localities—including Chauvet–Pont d’Arc in France, whose woolly rhinoceros illustrations date to between 33,000 and 30,000 years ago. Woolly rhinoceroses remained in northern Eurasia until at least 18,500 years ago, and scientific evidence suggests that they were not hunted to extinction by human beings. Rather, they likely died out from sudden climate changes brought on during the Bølling-Allerød interstadial, an interval that saw the rapid retreat of the Pleistocene ice sheets beginning about 14,700 years ago.</p>
